# Move to line start and end with `Ctrl a` and `Ctrl e`

## Script

### Overview

Welcome to the first in hopefully a long series of KeyKata videos.

The idea of KeyKata is for you to practice while watching the video.

All of the lesson materials, including the script for this video, are available
at https://github.com/keykata/dojo


### Setup

On MacOS, these shortcuts should work anywhere, with the notable exception of
Microsoft Office applications.

If you want to follow along in a UNIX terminal, you can use the terminal
included with MacOS or any Linux distribution. If you are using ChromeOS, you
need to enable Linux (Beta) under Settings. For Windows users, I recommend
installing [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or
[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

If you prefer not to use a terminal, you can install RStudio and enable its
Emacs mode. RStudio is available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows. I'll demo the
RStudio Emacs mode at the end of the video, but I already covered my RStudio
installation in my [RStudio setup materials](setup/00_rstudio-setup.md).

While keyboard customization is not required, I highly recommend setting up
Caps Lock and Enter to act as control when pressed with other keys. On MacOS,
this can be achieved by installing Karabiner and importing the two rules shown
here. For more, check out my [Karabiner setup
materials](setup/01_karabiner-setup.md).
