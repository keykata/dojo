The most common way to interact with a computer is through a Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In contrast, Text-based User Interfaces (TUIs) are typically appreciated only by power users who strive for maximum efficiency and productivity. There are numerous obstacles that prevent regular users from benefiting from TUIs. The first obstacle that new users face is the appearance of TUIs. To the uninitiated, TUIs can can appear to be cold, barren, and unwelcoming environments. Most TUIs are devoid of the colorful icons that are ubiquitous in GUIs and the lack of images can alienate new users. The absence of icons in most TUIs is related to second obstacle that new TUI users have to overcome: the limited role played by the computer mouse in TUIs. Most users are accustomed to having icons that they can
  - click on to perform actions or
  - hover over to obtain information.
TUIs are keyboard-centric by design and the use of the mouse is largely superfluous, but the inability to rely on the mouse can leave new users feeling powerless.
Of course, the appearance of many TUIs can be customized and mouse support can be enabled in TUIs such as vim (`set mouse=a`), emacs (`(xterm-mouse-mode 1)`), and tmux (`set -g mouse on`). This brings us to the 3rd obstacle that aspiring TUI users must surmount: the need to customize TUIs to achieve a quality user experience.

The fourth obstacle is the cognitive burden of remembering endless commands and keyboard shortcuts.

The UNIX shell offers many ways to access documentation on the command line is a useful skill that yields dividends
